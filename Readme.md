New Year Wish

I used this facebook bot to post on facebook on New Year midnight while I was 
partying with friends. The code is generic, and can be used to autopost on 
Facebook on any occasion. Yes, I know you can have too many ideas where autopost
in facebook is useful. So clone this barebones and do whatever the hell you like.

Code is in public domain.

You need to add a cron job at the time you wish to post to wget post.php. Thats
the way it rolls.
